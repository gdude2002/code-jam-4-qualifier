# Code Jam 4 Qualifier - The Login form
In order to qualify for this code jam, you should build a simple login form
based on the code in the file `qualifier.py`.

You should:
- `git clone` this repository into a directory on your computer.
- Run the module. Nothing will show up.
- Figure out why nothing shows up, and fix it.
- Add two fields to the form:
  - The username field should accept a string and do absolutely nothing with it.
  - The password field should accept a string and hide its input behind `*`
    characters. Aside from that, it should not do anything with it.
- Make the `Login` button change the content of the button to something
  absolutely meaningless.
